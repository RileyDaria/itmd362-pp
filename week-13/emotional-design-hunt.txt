# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:
I chose my table mirror that I use to put make up with as an object that 
* Visceral:
As far as appearance:
You can definitely tell that this is a mirror, but I think the legs that support the mirror itself with its 
curves makes it attractive, and sophisticated. You can definitely tell that this mirror is for a female, so it
has that kind of though to it(I am not sure how to explain)but it's like you can tell that its not for a little girl,
but for a woman. Plus I think it goes well with the wall frame that I have(you can see the side of the frame on one of the
pictures) It also has a curvy and elegant design, but I like how it is simple at the same time.

* Behavioral:
 It has a traditional shape, and the way the frame is
holding tells helps to understand that it is a table mirror. It is very functional too. I can perfectly sit it on the table,
and while I put my make up on, I can see the whole face. It has a functionality to fold the legs inside, so if I really need to put
it on the shelf I can do that as well. I can easily pick it up and hold too, if lets say I need to go to another room and see my face
in a different light.

* Reflective:
On the reflective level I can tell that this mirror makes me feel sophisticated too. Its elegant design is appealing
to me.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1.having the design that is familiar to everyone will make it intuitive for the user to be able to use the object
For example in the forms that we had to create for the payment, the goal was to design elements is a way that it is familiar to the user.
2. Then having a pleasing eye design in combination with simplicity is a good thing to implement. For example like we had a 
photo, then transparent layer, and then simply white frames and text (no crazy colors) made it clear and sophisticated at the same time
3. Then having different states that will help to have the functionality would help(like I can have the mirror sitting on the table, I can also 
hold it in my hands, and then I can also fold it and put it away) That can be applied in terms of having the design flexible, so then
user can see the application on a small screen and on the large screen as well.
