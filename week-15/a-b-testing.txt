# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

The interface component I chose to talk about in this production probmlem is the "bag" icon on the 
website that I use quite some times the website that plays on the idea of Github is Grubhub.com where you can order food from
different restaurants online. The problem with that icon is that is always gets me confused becasue it looks just like a lock icon
that is used in the web for security. If we look at the icon that comes with the https protocl, it looks the same!(to me at least)
So I as I order the items go to that "bag", so in order to see items that were previously chosed the user needs to click on that 
confusing "bag" icon. I understand that is hard to have an icon of a bag that will not look a lock.
Since the lock icon is assosiated with security, I get the idea that the food delivery would be in the bag, but I would suggest
to make it look more like a bag, and less like a lock. I dont have a photoshop on my system now, so I found some other pictures of bag icons
that will make that icon better. Those start with "solution"
So the solution would be simple, just replace the image scr to a different picture of a bag.
